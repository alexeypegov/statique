This is a simple note with an image being embedded.

Note, that if image has a '@2x' name postfix, it is processed as retina-ready and another similar image of 1x size is expected to be found, i.e. in this case two images should be prepared:

- clojure@2x.png for retina-based screent
- clojure.png for non-retina screens

![Some image](images/clojure@2x.png)
